I saw some presenter using a logitech spotlight. It is a versatile tool and improved the presentation focus. I thougt of trying to implement something similar. This project came out of that curiosity.

If you want to use it, then assign a shortcut key for the program. During your presentation just invoke by a shortcut key. You can move the program to the right monitor by pressing the right arrow. Your mouse changes to cross hair. If you click and drag a circular spotlight will be shown.
